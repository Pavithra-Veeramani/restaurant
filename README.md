# Dosa Hut
Welcome!
Dosa Hut is a fictious family owned restaurant which was founded in 2010.
In Indian cookery, a dosa is a crisp savoury pancake.
We are one of the popular restaurants in the town for creating crispy dosas.
We mainly focus on quality, customer satisfication and fulfiling their needs.
Our chefs are experts in creating all varieties of Indian foods, sweets and savouries.
