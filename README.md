# **Project plan**
I created a list of story items before starting development work. Googlesheet was used to maintain the list with description, target date, status and priority. The story items were both functional and technical tasks. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pRZyCN0FQD6l_kOCmg2Lx3cr5kEttCqoUYaKoG-ZjzA/edit?usp=sharing">Here </a> is a link to the stories.

# **Development and Technical approach**
  GitPod was used for rapid development and was able to quickly see the feedback in some kind of a hosted server.
  <ul>
    <li>Navigation menu - flex display</li>
    <li>Gallery responsiveness - Viewport width approach. The width for the images will be decided by the width of the device's screen</li>
    <li>Google map - Embedded link and iFrame</li>
    <li>Form - Contact Us form sibmitted to https://formdump.codeinstitute.net</li>
  </ul>
